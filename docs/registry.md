# The Registry object

As his name suggests, the registry object is an object that manages the registration of the library's strategies.

Each `ProtoGenerator` object contains a unique registry object.
In most cases, you only need to generate protos once. If this is not the case for you, you can reuse the same `ProtoGenerator` over and over.
